 **********************************************************************************************
 *
 * This is a multi-purpose device driver to operate the Dimension Engineering Sabertooth series
 * of H-Bridge motor controllers. These can be used to control permanent magnet DC motors
 * between 6 & 30 volts, up to 25 amps continuous and 50 amps surge.
 *
 * This driver works in the "Packetized Serial" mode, which must be set with the DIP
 * switches on the controller hardware. The driver defaults to operating only one
 * Sabertooth, using the lowest physical address of 128. The address is configurable in
 * the driver by assigning the address value to the constant "MOTOR_DRIVER_ADDRESS_x".
 *
 * The driver is written in the C language for Microchip PIC microcontrollers using CCS's
 * PIC-C Compiler, and was developed using version 4.120 of that compiler. I have also used it
 * with 32-bit PICs, using Microchip's C32 compiler.
 *
 * It should be easily convertible to other microcontrollers and compilers with minimal effort. I have
 * annotated the three lines which would have to be modified for a different compiler or
 * processor architecture.
